# Energy-Efficient Blockchain-enabled User-Centric Mobile Edge Computing

This is the simulation code of our paper in IEEE TCCN:''Energy-Efficient Blockchain-enabled User-Centric Mobile Edge Computing''.

**Abstract:** In the traditional mobile edge computing (MEC) system, the availability of MEC services is greatly limited for the edge users of the cell due to serious signal attenuation and inter-cell interference. User-centric MEC (UC-MEC) can be seen as a promising solution to address this issue, as well as provide sufficient resources for resource-consuming mobile applications. In UC-MEC, each user is served by a dedicated access point (AP) cluster enabled with MEC capability instead of a single MEC server, however, at the expense of noticeable energy consumption. To achieve reliable and efficient resource utilization with user-centric services, we propose an energy efficient blockchain-enabled UC-MEC where blockchain operations and resource optimization are jointly performed. Firstly, we design a resource-aware RAFT consensus mechanism followed by a smart contract to implement secure and reliable resource trading. Then, an optimization framework based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to minimize the total energy consumed by wireless transmission, consensus and task computing, where APs clustering, computing resource allocation and bandwidth allocation are jointly considered. Simulation results show superiority of the proposed UC-MEC system over reference schemes, at most 33.9% reduction in the total delay and 63.8% reduction in the total energy consumption.
